# routine
A Firefox browser extension to go through your routine webpages

To use, clone the repository then open Firefox's debugging page (type 'about:debugging' into the URL). 
Next, click on 'This Firefox' and then 'Load Temporary Add-on...'. Navigate to the repository and select "manifest.json"
An arrow icon should appear in your tool bar. Click on it and follow the instructions revealed by the 'help' button.

Some things I like to use routine for:
1. Quickly navigating my daily pages instead of having to type them in to the URL
2. Make sure I visit all the pages I intended (sometimes I skip a page on accident)
3. List an article that I want to read later

Enjoy your routine!
